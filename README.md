# Active Directory Project

### Objective

The objective of this project is to simulate an Active Directory (AD) environment with multiple machines, including both Windows and Linux systems. The setup involves configuring a Windows domain with AD, implementing monitoring and logging tools, and executing attack simulations to evaluate security defenses.

### Skills Learned

- Active Directory configuration and management.
- Centralized logging and analysis using Splunk.
- Network traffic and security event monitoring.
- Attack simulation using Atomic Red Team.

### Tools Used

- Kali Linux: Penetration testing (Crowbar).
- Windows Server 2022: Active Directory Domain Controller (ADDC), Sysmon, Splunk Universal Forwarder.
- Windows 10: Sysmon, Splunk Universal Forwarder, Atomic Red Team for attack simulation.
- Ubuntu Live Server 24.04.1 LTS: Splunk for centralized logging.
